## Project Setup and Run

### Installing from the App Store
If you'd like to just view the app, it is available in the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ditto.pos). No setup is required for this. If you'd like to build and run the app, see the instructions below.

### Building and Running the App in Android Studio
1. In your [Ditto portal](https://portal.ditto.live), create an app to generate an App ID and 
playground token.  
2. Clone this repo to a location on your machine, and open in Android Studio.    
3. Create a `local.properties` file or if you already have one, open it. 
4. In the `local.properties` file add the following entries (replacing with your actual App ID and playground token):
```
dittoOnlinePlaygroundAppId="your app id"
dittoOnlinePlaygroundToken="your playground token"
```
5. Hit the green play button to run the app
