## Project Setup and Run

### Installing from the App Store
If you'd like to just view the app, it is available in the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ditto-pos/id6449074700). No setup is required for this. If you'd like to build and run the app, see the instructions below.

### Building and Running the App in Xcode
1. Clone this repo to a location on your machine, and open in Xcode.    
2. Navigate to the project `Signing & Capabilities` tab and modify the `Team and Bundle Identifier` settings to your Apple developer account 
credentials to provision building to your device.  
3. In your [Ditto portal](https://portal.ditto.live), create an app to generate an App ID and 
playground token.   
4. In Terminal, run `cp .env.template .env` at the Xcode project root directory.   
5. Edit `.env` to add environment variables from the portal as in the following example:   
```DITTO_APP_ID=a01b2c34-5d6e-7fgh-ijkl-8mno9p0q12r3``` 
```DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN=a01b2c34-5d6e-7fgh-ijkl-8mno9p0q12r3```.  
6. Clean (**Command + Shift + K**), then build (**Command + B**). This will generate `Env.swift`. 
The project is now configured for the portal app.
